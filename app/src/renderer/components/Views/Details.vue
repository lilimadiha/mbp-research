            Big data is dataset that are large or so complex to analyse that the traditional data processing is insufficient. Nowadays, the dataset is become growing rapidly because the increase using the technology such numerous used on mobile devices, software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks and that become a big data problem. Dataset may consist of classification, clustering, prediction and other type pattern of data. In this research, will be more focus on classification pattern dataset.
            According to the researcher, the current technology memory original central processing unit (CPU) implementation take a long-time speed processing before the data become a significant consideration. However, since the Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) become more popular in market and started used in many areas and many researchers found that Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) can provide incredible performance of processing when compared to CPUs for computationally-intensive applications. Although the GPU provide incredible performance of processing, the result of speed latency may be different with CPU processing if analyse the different pattern of dataset and different algorithm. 
            In this research the classification dataset will analyse using MBP Algorithm between CPU and GPU processor to compare their performance to ensure the speed and time of training process are significantly improved. However, it will follow with the implementation in the application for good visualization application such as graph visualization.
